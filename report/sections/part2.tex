\section{Part 2: Intermediate Features}

\subsection{Feature Description}
This section details the intermediate features implemented in the project. These features include determining a "performance" metric for airports and displaying a radar chart to compare airport performance given a list of airports, charting region and state performance on a US map, and displaying a table of the best and worst performing states in each US region.

\paragraph{Task 1: Compare the performance of airports across the dataset} TEMP\\
This task allows the user to choose a list of airports and compare their performance based on a performance metric. The performance metric is calculated based on the following factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The percentage of flights that were delayed when departing.
    \item The percentage of flights that were delayed when arriving.
    \item The percentage of flights that were cancelled.
    \item The percentage of flights that were diverted.

\paragraph{Task 2: Chart and analyze region and state performance} TEMP\\
